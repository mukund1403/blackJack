        <p>Place your bet before clicking start game</p>
        <p>You can win the game, either by having a total score higher than the dealer's or getting exactly 21</p>
        <p>If your score is higher than the dealers, you will win your bet amount. If it is 21, you win double your bet amount</p>
        <p>If the sum of your cards go over 21 you will be bust and lose the game!</p>
        <p>If the sum is below 21, you can choose to draw a third card or stay</p>
        <p>Once you choose to stay it will be the dealers turn</p>
        <p>Jack, King and Queen are all 10 points while Ace is 11</p>
